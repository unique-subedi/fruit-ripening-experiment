## Permutation tests on consecutive days

We are also interested in whether each of the treatments accelerates the ripening on each of the five days. We consider four combinations of permutation tests: (1) permutation test on RGB magnitude by difference-in-means; (2) permutation test on RGB magnitude by difference-in-medians; (3) permutation test on RGB green value by difference-in-means; (4) permutation test on RGB green value by difference-in-medians. The permutation is implemented on the treatments of 6 bananas, three of which is in the control group and the other three in a treatment group.  For each test, we have 3 p-values for 3 'treatment v.s. control' groups on each of the five days. The results are summarized in the following plots:

As shown in the figures, there is no significant ripening effect among the treatments on each day.
