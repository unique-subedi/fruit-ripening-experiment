# fruit-ripening-experiment

## Workflow

1. Make a copy of the master notebook and save a copy of a notebook indexed by your name (eg. Unique_fruit_ripening.ipynb).

2. Write all the code in your copy of the notebook and push your notebook to github. In colab, you can click File --> Save a copy in Github to save the notebook directly to the repo of your choice. 

3. At the end, we can merge all usable code into the master notebook for the report/presentation.
