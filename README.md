## Workflow

1. Make a copy of the master notebook and save a copy of a notebook indexed by your name (eg. Unique_fruit_ripening.ipynb).

2. Write all the code in your copy of the notebook and push your notebook to github. In colab, you can click File --> Save a copy in Github to save the notebook directly to the repo of your choice. 

3. At the end, we can merge all usable code into the master notebook for the report/presentation.

## Pre-analysis plan

Write down our pre-analysis plan here:
1. What fruit/treatment(s) do we want to use?
2. How do we assess the ripeness? Do we want it to be ordinal/continuous data?
3. What statistical tools do we use for our analysis? test statistic?

## Experiment log

We can use the markdown file as the experimental notebook. Let us index each log by the date and if there are multiple logs for each day, lets index by date-time pair. 


Oct 13: Created the group and set up the workflow. Brainstromed techniques for assessing ripening.
